# WHAT IS IT?
afl-tmin uses a bunch of heuristics to simplify testcases as much as it can to exhibit the same behavior as before
# TO SETUP
SEE afl-fuzz

# TO USE
afl-tmin -i /path/to/testcase -o /path/to/minimized/testcase [-Q] /path/to/binary [<binary args>]


# TIPS
    SEE afl-fuzz
    - AFL_TMIN_EXACT=1 forces the path to match the one as the crash, this is useful because
      otherwise it will consider all paths that still crash as the same behavior. If the program
      heavily sanity checks its input and `abort()`s when incorrect this makes it unusable otherwise
