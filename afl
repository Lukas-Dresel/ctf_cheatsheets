# WHAT IS IT?
AFL is a mutational genetic fuzzer with branch-tracking for coverage feedback.
Always good to run first thing on challenge binaries, CPU is literally free!
With QEMU mode should be usable on almost all challenge binaries that use stdin.

# TO SETUP
export AFL_PATH=/path/to/afl/root/dir
Symptoms when missing:
    - can't find afl-qemu-trace

export PATH=$PATH:$AFL_PATH


# TO USE
afl-tmin -i /path/to/testcase -o /path/to/minimized/testcase [-Q] /path/to/binary [<binary args>]

afl-cmin -i /path/to/all/tests -o /nonexistent/path/to/dump/minimized/tests [-Q] /path/to/binary [<binary args>]

# TIPS
    - AFL_PRELOAD environment variable allows to LD_PRELOAD in the target binary! 
      Use, e.g. with github.com/zardus/preeny.git' to fuzz network binaries or to patch out problematic stuff
